My research interest is in searching for new physics phenomena at collider experiments. Our group are currently studying the Standard Model of fundamental particles with ultra-rare processes containing multiple heavy gauge bosons and high precision test of lepton flavor violation with the [CMS experiment](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) at the CERN LHC. Our group is developing advanced [real-time data processing techniques based on Machine Learning methods in embedded systems or with heteregenous compute](https://fastmachinelearning.org/index.html). At the Purdue Silicion Detector Lab, semiconductor detector modules for the next upgrade of the CMS detector are being tested and studied by our undergraduate and graduate student researchers.
