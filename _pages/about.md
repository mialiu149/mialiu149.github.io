I am a particle physicist and my research focuses on finding experimental evidences towards deeper understanding of space and time. Our group is studying the highest energy proton-proton collision data collected by the [Compact Muon Solenoid experiment(CMS)](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms) at the CERN LHC, currently the largest collider in the world. Our group hunts for hints of new physics phenomena, beyond the Standard Model of fundamental particles, with ultra-rare processes such as those containing multiple heavy gauge bosons or violating the lepton universality. To harness the big data at unprecedente rate and volume at the LHC and the future upgrade, our group is developing [real-time artificial intelligence in embedded systems or with heteregenous compute](https://home.cern/science/experiments/cms). We are also building semiconductor tracker modules for the next CMS detector upgrade, that will operate in harsh radiation enviroment to collect data at an unprecedented rate. Previously, I have worked on searches for supersymmetry particles and the CMS pixel detector, see my CV and [google scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=h8JQ0nYAAAAJ) for more.

I am currently managing the activities in the operations area for the [US.CMS software and computing operations program](https://uscms-software-and-computing.github.io/). I am also leading the efforts of enabling machine learning based methods in CMS offline data processing and the utilization of heteregeneous computing platforms.
